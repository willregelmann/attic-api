# Storage Setup for Railway Deployment

Since Railway deployments are ephemeral (files are lost on redeploy), you need to set up persistent storage for uploaded images. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Railway Volumes (Recommended for simplicity)

Railway now supports persistent volumes that can be attached to your service through their UI.

### Setup Steps:

1. **Create a Volume in Railway**
   - Go to your Railway project
   - Select your API service
   - Go to the "Settings" tab
   - Scroll to "Volumes" section
   - Click "Add Volume"
   - Set mount path to: `/storage`
   - Set size (1GB should be plenty for a hobby project)

2. **Deploy the Updated Code**
   - The `start.sh` script will automatically detect the Railway volume
   - It will create the necessary directories and symlinks
   - Images will be stored persistently in the volume

3. **That's it!**
   - No additional configuration needed
   - Images will persist across deployments
   - The volume is automatically backed up by Railway

### How it Works:
- Railway sets `RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH` environment variable
- Our start.sh script detects this and symlinks Laravel's storage to the volume
- All uploaded images go to the persistent volume
- The public symlink is recreated on each deploy

## Option 2: Cloudflare R2 (For larger scale)

Cloudflare R2 is S3-compatible storage with no egress fees and a generous free tier (10GB storage, 10 million requests/month).

### Setup Steps:

1. **Create Cloudflare R2 Bucket**
   - Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
   - Navigate to R2
   - Create a new bucket (e.g., `attic-images`)
   - Enable public access for the bucket

2. **Generate API Credentials**
   - In R2, go to "Manage R2 API tokens"
   - Create new API token with Object Read & Write permissions
   - Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

3. **Configure Railway Environment Variables**
   Add these to your Railway service:
   ```
   FILESYSTEM_DISK=r2
   R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
   R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
   R2_BUCKET=attic-images
   R2_ENDPOINT=https://YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
   R2_URL=https://your-public-bucket-url.r2.dev
   ```

4. **Install AWS S3 SDK**
   The Laravel app needs the S3 package:
   ```bash
   composer require league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3 "^3.0"
   ```

## Option 3: AWS S3

Traditional S3 storage (costs for storage and bandwidth).

### Setup Steps:

1. **Create S3 Bucket**
   - Go to AWS Console â†’ S3
   - Create new bucket
   - Configure public access settings
   - Set up CORS if needed

2. **Create IAM User**
   - Create user with S3 access
   - Attach policy for bucket access
   - Generate access keys

3. **Configure Railway Environment Variables**
   ```
   FILESYSTEM_DISK=s3
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
   AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
   AWS_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
   AWS_URL=https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
   ```

## Option 4: Supabase Storage

Supabase offers storage with their PostgreSQL database service.

### Setup Steps:

1. **Enable Storage in Supabase**
   - Go to your Supabase project
   - Navigate to Storage
   - Create a new bucket for images

2. **Get API Credentials**
   - Find your project URL and anon key
   - Configure storage policies for public access

3. **Implement Custom Storage Driver**
   You'll need to create a custom Laravel storage driver for Supabase.

## Option 5: Keep Local (Development Only)

For development/testing, you can use local storage, but images will be lost on each Railway deploy.

No additional configuration needed, just ensure:
```
FILESYSTEM_DISK=public
```

## Testing Your Configuration

After setting up storage, test it:

1. Upload an image through the admin panel
2. Check if the image persists after a redeploy
3. Verify the image URL is accessible

## Troubleshooting

### Images not showing after deploy
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify bucket permissions allow public read
- Check Laravel logs for storage errors

### Upload fails
- Verify credentials are correct
- Check bucket exists and is writable
- Ensure file size limits aren't exceeded

### CORS Issues
- Configure CORS on your storage bucket
- Add your domain to allowed origins

## Recommended: Railway Volumes

For a hobby project, Railway Volumes are recommended because:
- Simple setup through Railway UI
- No additional services or accounts needed
- Automatic backups included
- No extra configuration required
- Works out of the box with the updated start.sh script
- Perfect for small to medium projects

The code is already configured to support Railway volumes - just add the volume in Railway's UI!
